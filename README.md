# React Movie App

This is a simple React-based web application that displays a list of movies fetched from the [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). The app allows users to search for movies and view details about each movie, such as its release date, rating, and synopsis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Walid-Khalfa/React_Movie_App.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Obtain an API key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and add it to the `.env` file in the root directory of the project: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. From there, you can search for movies and view details about them.
